# OrcaHello: A real-time AI-assisted killer whale notification system üé± üêã

Orcasound has set up hydrophones in the Puget Sound. Whales sometimes swim by these hydrophones and vocalize in the form of calls.

We trained a deep learning model to detect these calls in the hydrophone audio. Each sub-segment is classified as whale call/ no-whale call.
Shown below is a 1-minute segment of hydrophone audio visualized as a spectrogram with whale calls detected by the model.

When whale-activity is detected by the model, it sends an email to our Moderators who are human killer whale experts.

Once they receive this email, they can visit the Moderator Portal to confirm model detections and act as an oracle.

Most importantly, they tag detections with information if the whale call was a southern resident killer whale - a specific type found in the Puget Sound. If a SRKW is confirmed, an email is sent to subscribers.

This repository contains the implementations for the components
- ModeratorFrontEnd - Frontend code for website - insert link.
- NotificationSystem - Code to trigger emails on whale call detections.
- InferenceSystem - Code to run forward inference with the trained model.
